# LyceumAI

![](https://github.com/Lyceum/LyceumAI.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

LyceumAI is a component package of the Lyceum ecosystem. It provides tools and frameworks to
support algorithm development for continous control problems, such as trajectory optimization and
reinforcement learning. Checkout the [documentation](https://docs.lyceum.ml/dev/) for more
information about Lyceum and LyceumAI.jl.

# Algorithms
LyceumAI currently comes with Natural Policy Gradient, an on-policy Policy Gradient method
referenced in [Towards Generalization and Simplicity in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02660.pdf),
as well a [Model Predictive Path Integral](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/files/InformationTheoreticMPC.pdf),
an indirect shooting method for trajectory optimization and model predictive control.
